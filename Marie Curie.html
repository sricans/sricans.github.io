	<p>Born Maria Sklodowska on November 7, 1867, Marie Curie became the first woman to win a Nobel Prize and the first person-man or woman-to win the award twice. Curie's efforts, with her husband pierre Curie, led to the discovery of polanium and radium and after Pierre's death, the furher development of X-rays. The famed scientiest died on July 4, 1934.</p>

	<p>Marie Curie discovered radioactivity, and together with her husband Pierre, the radioactivite elements polonium and radium, while working the mineral pitchblende.</p>
	<p>Fascinated with he work of Henri Becquerel, a French phisicisr who decovered that uranium casts off rays weaker than the X-rays found by Wilhem Conrad Roentgen, Marie Curie took this work a few steps further. Curie conducted her own experimwnts on uranium rays and discovered that they remained constants, no matter the condition or form of the uranium. THe rays, she theorized, came from the element's atomic structure. This revolutionary idea created he field of atomic physics. Curie herself coined the word "radioactvity" to describe the phenomena.</p>
	<p>Following Marie's discovery of radioactivity, she continued her research with her husband. Working with the mineral pitchblende, the pair the discovered a new radioactivity element in 1898. They named the element polonium, after Marie;s native country of Poland. They also detected the presence of another radioactivite material in the pitchlende, and called that radium. In 1902, the Curies announced they had a decigram of pure radium, demonstrating its existence as a unique chemical element.</p>
